So, We have to design a Ml model which can detect the fraud Transaction( Here the transaction are home lone related Transaction) so we have data .csv of 20 columns 
That columns are:-
Transaction Type
Account number
Account type
class code
collatrael code
Short name
post_date
effective date
transaction code
actio code
Field number
field chgdesc
interest
principle
misc
description
operator_id
operator_name
batch_number
total
so in the data for each transaction we dont have some values for some transactions like field name, Field change
so we have derive features from this data. features like 
Transaction Amount:
Transaction Date and Time:
Transaction Frequency:
Account Age:
Historical Transaction Data:
Transaction Velocity:
Behavioral Biometrics
Account Balance
Geo-Velocity
write a python code to extract that features and store it in .csv file
